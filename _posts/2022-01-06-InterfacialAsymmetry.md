Controlling electrochemical reactivity requires a detailed understanding of
the charging behavior and thermodynamics of the electrochemical interface.
Experiments can independently probe the overall charge response of the
electrochemical double layer by capacitance measurements and the thermodynamics
of the inner layer with potential of maximum entropy measurements.
Relating these properties by computational modeling of the electrochemical
interface has so far been challenging due to the low accuracy of classical
molecular dynamics (MD) for capacitance and the limited time and length scales
of <i>ab initio</i> MD.

Here, we combine large ensembles of long-time-scale classical MD simulations
with charge response from electronic density functional theory to predict the
potential-dependent capacitance of a family of ideal aqueous electrochemical
interfaces with different peak capacitances.
We show that while the potential of maximum capacitance varies, this entire
family exhibits an electrode charge of maximum capacitance (CMC) between −2.9
and −2.2 &mu;C/cm<sup>2</sup>, regardless of the details in the electronic response.
Simulated heating of the same interfaces reveals that the entropy peaks at a
charge of maximum entropy (CME) of −5.1 &plusmn; 0.6 &mu;C/cm<sup>2</sup>, in agreement with
experimental findings for metallic electrodes.
The CME and CMC both indicate asymmetric response of interfacial water that is
stronger for negatively charged electrodes, while the difference between CME
and CMC illustrates the richness in behavior of even the ideal
electrochemical interface.
